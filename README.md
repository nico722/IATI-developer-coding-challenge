## Developer setup
```
# Create and activate a python3 virtual environment (recommended)
$ python3 -m venv pyenv
$ source pyenv/bin/activate

# Install project dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

Tests are run using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/):

```
$ py.test
```

## Alternative instructions
You can use a `make` command to run the program, but you need to have install `virtualenv` and `python3`

- make install
- make run
- make test
